Dedicated repo for IBM Data Science Certificate Capstone on Coursera. This repo contains 2 notebooks:
  1. `TORONTO NEIGHBORHOOD - Week 3.ipynb` contains analysis, visualization, and clustering of neighborhoods in the city of Toronto based on each neighborhood's venues from Foursquare. In conlusion, the analysis showed ***5 clusters*** of neighborhoods exhibiting distict characteristics.
  2. `IBM Data Science Capstone.ipynb` is the main capstone project, ***attempting to create a guide for visitors or recent movers to Research Triangle Park, North Carolina (including Durham, Raleigh, Chapel Hill)***. This will also use clustering methods to show similar neighborhoods within these 3 cities of the region.
   * **Notice:** Section 2b-Data collection of this notebook is stored in a separate notebook to save compiling time. If you are running the project for the first time, you ***have to run section 2b first*** before running the main notebook.
